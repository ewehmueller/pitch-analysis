    "A hot topic in the 2021 Major League Baseball season surrounds discussion about certain substances being used by pitchers to increase their \"spin rate\"- an advanced metric now being recorded on every pitch by sophisticated cameras.  The argument is that a higher spin rate on pitches gives better results, and this substance is legal and used by a high percentage of pitchers around the league.  However, this is not the singular determining factor in throwing an effective pitch: namely, one that will cause a Major League better to swing and miss. Although typically regarded as an \"old man's game\", can we get a step ahead of the game and leverage this metric and a variety of other data on pitches to know what types of pitches will give us the best results?  \n",

    "We have been hired as a hypothetical member of the Cardinals baseball organization: a member of the coaching staff.  As a coaching analyst, our job is to create a model that will give us insights into pitch quality and classify a pitch, given its metrics, as a \"strike\" or a red flag \"hit\" for our opponent.\n",
